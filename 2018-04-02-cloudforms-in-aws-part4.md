CloudForms in AWS part 4
Posted on: April 2, 2018
Laurent Domb, Red Hat  
In this post of our series, we will demonstrate what we did in the previous sections in which we configured AWS and CloudForms, to run a SmartStaty analysis to automatically resolve a vulnerability in Java
In the video, I will:
Perform a SmartState Analysis (SSA) in my instance
Review the SSA process
Add a compliance policy to the instance
Execute the policy
Verify the remediation action
Validate the auto-remediation
