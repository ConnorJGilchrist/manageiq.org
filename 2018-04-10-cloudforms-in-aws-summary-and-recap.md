For the last few posts [Laurent Domb] [https://www.redhat.com/en/blog] has been explaining how to squeeze CloudForms and AWS integration by teaching you how to:
Upload the CF images to AWS
Create all the needed config files in AWS
Deploy CF on AWS
Configure the new in 4.6 SmartState Analysis (SSA)
Use that SSA to add a compliance policy to an instance
Use AWS authentication in CF
